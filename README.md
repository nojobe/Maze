# Maze
This is a school assignment from a C++ programming workshop. Most this work is my own, but the assignment was given with some starter code. Most of the code with
comments before a block and inline comments is mine.
This program is a game where the player controls a character (animal emoji) and attempts to make it to a goal point on a board while avoiding obstacles and 
and hostile elements on the boards. The game is turn-based and the player types their move commands("UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT") into the terminal.
